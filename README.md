# Scraping-YouTube-Trending-Page

## What this is.
- A Selenium script to scrape the YouTube Trending page and extract all the video stats

## Why.
- Having only worked with ```beautifulsoup4``` before, I wanted to explore ```selenium``` as well.
- A friend wanted to analyze the YouTube Data and build a prediction model for a particular usecase. I wrote this script to help him get the trending page data easily on a daily basis.
- I got two pizzas in return :P

## Scope for improvement.
