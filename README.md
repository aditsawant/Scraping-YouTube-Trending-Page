# Scraping-YouTube-Trending-Page

## What this is.
- A Selenium script to scrape the YouTube Trending page and extract all the video stats
- You can see [this CSV file](https://github.com/aditsawant/Scraping-YouTube-Trending-Page/blob/master/Trending_Page_Data.csv) for a demo of how the data will look like.

## Why.
- Having only worked with ```beautifulsoup4``` before, I wanted to explore ```selenium``` as well.
- A friend wanted to analyze the YouTube Data and build a prediction model for a particular usecase. I wrote this script to help him get the trending page data easily on a daily basis.
- I got two pizzas in return :P

## Scope for improvement.
- Extract first hundred comments and perform Sentiment Analysis on them to rate the quality of content out of 10.
- Scrape other stats about the YouTubers (might be useful data).
